Changes in version 2.0.1

   o Fix a bug with violating and runs when "chart.all" is FALSE. 
   
Changes in version 2.0

   o Multivariate control charts (T^2, T^2 for individual observations, 
     Ellipse chart for bivariate data) have been included.

   o 'sd.xbar.one' now allows to estimate the standard deviation by using
     the moving range (default as in the previous versions) or the method
     suggested by Ryan (2000) using the scaled std deviation of the
     observations.

   o 'cusum' and 'ewma' have been rewritten to be called directly with data
     and arguments. No need to create a 'qcc' object before.

   o Added a NAMESPACE, exporting all functions with names not starting with
     a dot '.'. 

Changes in version 2.1

   o Redefined 'std.dev' argument in qcc() function. It now allows to give
     a numerical value or a sting identifying a method for estimating the 
     standard deviation of a continuous process variable. Thus, these 
     methods are only available to "xbar", "R", and "S" charts. For details
     see help(qcc).
     Functions involved in change are std.xbar(), std.R(), std.S(), while
     the other sd.* functions only have "..." argument added.

   o If xbar chart is needed and the number of observations is larger than
     25 use "RMSDF" method for computing process standard deviation.

   o Fixed bug in highlighting violating runs and out of control points 
     when chart.all = FALSE.

   o Changed background color for Control Charts.

   o Changed position of control limit labels in Shewhat and CusSum charts.

Changes in version 1.2

   o Added functions to plot Shewhart g chart (geometric distribution):
     stats.g(), sd.g(), limits.g()

   o Bug fix in violating.runs()
   
   o Changes in qcc.options():
     - run.length set by default at 7 (it was 5 previously)
     - 'font.stats' and 'cex.stats' control font and character expansion
       used to draw text at the bottom of control charts

   o Added qcc_Rnews.pdf paper in doc directory
   
Changes in version 1.1

   o Fixed some minor bugs
   
   o Reworked on par settings to allow multiple figures
   
   o Corrected typos in .Rd files
