Changes to Version 1.2

   o Redefined 'std.dev' argument in qcc() function. It now allows to give
     a numerical value or a sting identifying a method for estimating the 
     standard deviation of a continuous process variable. Thus, these 
     methods are only available to "xbar", "R", and "S" charts. For details
     see help(qcc).
     Functions involved in change are std.xbar(), std.R(), std.S(), while
     the other sd.* functions only have "..." argument added.

   o Fixed bug in highlighting violating runs and out of control points 
     when chart.all = FALSE.

   o Changed background color for Control Charts.

   o Changed position of control limit labels in Shewhat and CusSum charts.
